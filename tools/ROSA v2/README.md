# ROSA V2 Customer Set Up Script

This script is used to quickly deploy a Cloudflare ROSA tunnel using the JSON and Config.yml files we provide.

# Requirements
Before attempting to run this script you will need to have received a JSON and Config.yml files from Ivanti. These files are needed to authenticate and configure your specific tunnel to connect to our Cloudflare edge. In addition the location you attempt to deploy Cloudflare's agent needs to have access to the services you are attempting to set up connectors for. If you would like to minimize the access that the Cloudflare agent has you can use the following information on the ports and IP's needed for the agents access: https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/configuration/ports-and-ips/
